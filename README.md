# The (Resale) Price is Right! (In progress) 
## A machine learning project predicting HDB Resale prices in Singapore (2017-2019) 
This project examines data on HDB resale flat transactions in Singapore between 2017-2019, attempting to predict resale prices using a few regression machine learning models. These include linear regression, neural networks and regression trees/forests.The first segment of the project is creating an interactive dashboard for users to learn more about resale HDB transactions across Singapore between 2017-2019. 

The second part of the project involves using various machine learning techniques to predict the resale price of a flat, given certain characteristics. The models used are (1) linear regression, (2) neural networks and (3) regression trees. They are trained and test against the same data set, and compared based on their root mean squared error (RMSE) score. These models can be used to understand significant factors influencing resale prices and even predict those of future flats. 

## Project Objectives
The (Resale) Price is Right was initiated to study HDB resale data in Singapore, identifying key trends as well as attempting to predict prices of future units given certain characteristics. It is also an opportunity for me to delve deeper into regression machine learning models, and apply them to an experiential project.

## Acknowledgements 
Thank you for your interest in my project. I hope you enjoy looking through the deliverables in this repository. 

I would like to acknowledge the SMU Business Intelligence and Analytics Club for the opportunity to be part of the Data Associate Fast Track Programme. The programme allowed me to pick up Python 3 and machine learning concepts to embark on this project. 

Finally, this project would not have been possible without the help and support of my partner, Jocelyn.

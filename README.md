## Acknowledgements 
Thank you for your interest in my project. I hope you enjoy looking through the deliverables in this repository. 

I would like to acknowledge the SMU Business Intelligence and Analytics Club for the opportunity to be part of the Data Associate Fast Track Programme. The programme allowed me to pick up Python 3 and machine learning concepts to embark on this project. 

Finally, this project would not have been possible without the help and support of my partner, Jocelyn.
